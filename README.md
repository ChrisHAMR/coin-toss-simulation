# Coin Toss Simulation — Probability Foundations

This project uses Monte Carlo simulation to build intuition for fundamental concepts in probability and mathematical statistics.

Rather than focusing on closed-form derivations, the emphasis is on understanding randomness, convergence, and sampling behavior through repeated simulation.

## Topics Covered
1. Single coin toss experiments
2. Probability estimation and the Law of Large Numbers
3. Biased coin simulations
4. Sampling distributions from repeated experiments
5. Monte Carlo methods:
   - Rare event estimation (runs and streaks)
   - Confidence interval construction
   - Streak and run behavior in random sequences

## Motivation
Simulation-based reasoning underlies many modern statistical methods, including Monte Carlo inference, Bayesian modeling, and risk analysis.  
This project reinforces probabilistic intuition that supports more advanced statistical modeling.

## Structure
- `notebooks/coin_toss_simulation.ipynb`: main simulation notebook
- `figures/`: generated plots

## Status
